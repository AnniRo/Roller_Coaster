# Roller_Coaster

This project consists a practice of the Python's Matplotlib library and the goal is to create several data visualizations
in order to gain insight into the world of roller coasters.

Roller coasters are often split into two main categories based on their construction material: wood or steel. 
Rankings for the best wood and steel roller coasters from the 2013 to 2018 Golden Ticket Awards are provided
in 'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Wood.csv' and 'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Steel.csv', respectively.  
Also, in 'roller_coasters.csv' there are data stored on all roller coasters documented on [Captain Coaster](https://captaincoaster.com/en/)
(a popular site for recording roller coaster information) that have been accessed through its API.
